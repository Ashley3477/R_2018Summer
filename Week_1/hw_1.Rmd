# 變數
# Ordered Factors

factor_speed_vector <- factor(speed_vector, ordered = TRUE, levels = c("slow", "medium", "fast"))

 Print factor_speed_vector
factor_speed_vector
# Create speed_vector
speed_vector <- c("medium", "slow", "slow", "medium", "fast")

 Add your code below
factor_speed_vector <- factor(speed_vector, ordered = TRUE, levels = c("slow", "medium", "fast"))

 Print factor_speed_vector
factor_speed_vector
summary(factor_speed_vector)d_vector)



## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
